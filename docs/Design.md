# Design of Dashboard Styling
The dashboard and category-based note pages were, unlike the rest of the app, using Styled Components. `DashboardStyling.js` stores the generic styling components that can be reused for tracking of other productivity aspects.

As of 6/14/2023, the file is used to store the styling for layouting the Notes Dashboard including the following features:
1. Utility sidebar
2. Utility menu
3. Organized project subsections (like notes)
