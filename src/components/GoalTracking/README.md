# Goal Tracking

Here lies where we'll implement the minified todo-app part of our main website. In our quick sketch of how our website is meant to look (at the top directory of this project/repo),

This part of the app allows the user to create and manage their own goals.

The user simply has to type in their goal in the text box, and when they are finished typing, they can either hit 'Enter' or click on the 'Add' button next to the text box.

Once the goal is added, it will be displayed under the text box (if more than 1 goal is added it will be added underneath the previous goal). Here the user will have the additional option of marking the goal as 'Completed' or 'Trash" the goal- which removes the goal from the display list.
